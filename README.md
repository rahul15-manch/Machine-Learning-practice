Supervised Machine Learning Models
📌 Overview
This repository contains implementations of various Supervised Machine Learning models built using Python and popular data science libraries.
It covers both classification and regression techniques with clear, commented code for learning and practice.

🧠 Models Implemented:
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gradient Boosting (Ada Boost, Gradient Boost)


📊Features:
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
Model training & evaluation
Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, RMSE)
Visualization of results using Matplotlib and Plotly

🚀Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
